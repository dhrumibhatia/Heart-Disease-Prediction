## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on a given set of medical parameters. This model will aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, risk assessment, and preventive measures.

## Data and Methodology

### Dataset:

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Utilized a publicly available heart disease dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset comprises various features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and total 14 variable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted in-depth EDA to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
* Visualized key insights using appropriate plots and charts.

## Feature Engineering:

Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance, including:
* Creating new features based on existing ones.
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Normalizing or standardizing numerical features.

## Model Selection and Training:

Experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
Ultimately, Logistic Regression was selected as the best-performing model for this specific dataset and problem.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
* Explore advanced techniques to optimize hyperparameters for improved model performance.
## Ensemble Methods:
* Experiment with ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting to further enhance predictive accuracy.

## Future Work:

## Model Deployment:
### Deployment Platform:

Consider using a suitable platform like Flask, Streamlit, Gradio or Heroku to deploy the model as a web application.
Create a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.

## Deep Learning:
* Investigate the potential of deep learning models, especially for complex datasets and feature engineering.
## Explainable AI:
* Incorporate techniques to make the model's predictions more interpretable, aiding in clinical decision-making.

## Conclusion
By effectively addressing heart disease prediction, this project aims to contribute to early intervention and improved patient outcomes
